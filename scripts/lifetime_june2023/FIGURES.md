## CELLFIT PART II PAPER/FIGURES OUTLINE (JOULE)

(1) Schematic of methodology
(2) Multivariate Kernel Density Estimates -- show 2D in paper, 3D in SI and in presentations
(3) Show Importance of MvKDE -- that you can't just take a norm
(4) Show Calculated Solutions for Some Sets Of Models (potentially multiple figures divided by electrode)
(5) Show Summary Figures -- which models are most accurate (symbolic regression)
(6) Show things people care about -- capacity, resistance, max T, min V, MSE, etc.

## Potential SI/other figures
- Thermal model
- 3D Kernel Density Plots
- All combinations of all models
- Model schematic
- KDE for rosenbrock distribution or some other crazy distribution
- Convergence plots
